#  GIWidget （GI小组件）

This is a project written to learn and practice how to use Swift language and macOS SDK.
It should be noted that this project was inspired by a dynamic wallpaper I previously saw on the Wallpaper Engine.

## Usage
1. a Mac powered by Apple Silicon
2. build it yourself or download a prebuild .dmg file to install
3. copy images(.png, .jpg, .jpeg, etc. {no .webp}) by using the GIWidget's UI
4. add widgets to your desktop or Notification Center. Right click to modify them.

## Build it
macOS SDK 14.0 is required. I use Xcode version:15.3 to finish this product.

## Future plans
1. make「group」feature truely work.
2. change sentences and imgs by setting "key" to the widget
3. translations UI into English.

## Notice
Open source software, without any warranty!
